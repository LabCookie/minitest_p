Minitest is a survival [Luanti](https://luanti.org/) game mainly inspired by [Minicraft](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicraft) and similar games.

You wake up in a lush colorful world with no recollection who or where you are, and you must thrive.
Start off by gathering *twigs* and *rocks* and using your trusty stone axe to chop down trees, before making a workbench using 2 planks and *staffs*.
###### I was bad at english when naming these items, okay?

Requires Luanti 5.10 to run properly.
The ingame colors and textures mostly use the 16 color palette taken from the [Commodore 64](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) with a resolution of 8x8 pixels, with plenty of tweaks and adjustments to visuals.
### This game is **work-in-progress** and major refactoring is on the way. Expect game-breaking bugs and issues.
